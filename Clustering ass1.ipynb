    "Q2.What is K-means clustering, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans-> Make groups of different diff datasets will convert data into diff diff group in the form of clusters.\n",
    "Step1) initialize the k value(centroid)\n",
    "step2) points that are nearest to the centroid make a group or cluster\n",
    "step3) Move the entroid and take the average of data points \n",
    "step4) repeat the above process until a particular cluster belongs from a particular dataset/cluster/group.\n",

    "Q3. What are some advantages and limitations of K-means clustering compared to other clustering\n",
    "techniques?\n",
    "Ans-> K-means clustering can handle big datasets,also applicable for numerical value,k-means is faster than heirarichal\n",
    "It is very easy to understand and implement.\n",

    "Q4. How do you determine the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering, and what are some\n",
    "common methods for doing so?\n",
    "Ans->This is done by simply calculating the silhouette coefficient over a range of k, & identifying the peak as optimum K.\n",

    "Q5. What are some applications of K-means clustering in real-world scenarios, and how has it been used\n",
    "to solve specific problems?\n",
    "Ans->kmeans algorithm is very popular and used in a variety of applications such as market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation and image compression, fraud detection, predicting account attrition,cybercrime identification, etc.\n",
